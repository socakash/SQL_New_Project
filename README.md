## Background
Curious to investigate the data analyst job market more effectively, this project was born from a desire to pinpoint top-paid and in-demand skills, streamlining others work to find optimal jobs.

It's packed with insights on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills.

The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:
1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

## Tools I Used
I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- SQL: The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.

- PostgreSQL: The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.

- Visual Studio Code: My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.

- Git & GitHub: Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market. Hereâ€™s how I approached each question:

### 1. Top Paying Jobs
To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.
```
SELECT
    job_title_short,
    job_title,
    company_dim.name,
    job_country,
    salary_year_avg
FROM 
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim 
ON
job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_location = 'Anywhere'
    AND
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
Here's the breakdown of the top data jobs:

- **Wide Salary Range:** Top 10 paying data analyst roles span from $184,000 to $650,000, indicating significant salary potential in the field.
